    Grok v: To understand deeply and intuitively

GrokeryLab is a data pipeline management platform.


## Usage

You can find instructions for running the app and the api in the README files in their respective folders.

Once you've got the api and app running, you can initialize a user with `createInitialAdminUser.sh` in the /scripts folder. You should then be able to login using the newly created admin user.
