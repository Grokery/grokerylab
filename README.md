# GrokeryLab

    Grok v: To understand deeply and intuitively

GrokeryLab is a data pipeline management platform.


## Usage

You can find instructions for running the app and the api in the README files in their respective folders.

Once you've got the api and app running, you can initialize the required superadmin user with the initSuperuser.sh script found in the /scripts folder.

Finaly, use the superadmin account credentials you created in the last step and the createAdminUser.sh script to create a normal admin user that you can use to login via the app ui.
